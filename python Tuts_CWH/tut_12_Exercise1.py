#Create a dictionary and taking input from the user and return the meaning of the word from the dictionary.

# Def = {"Set": "It is the collection of an data", "Reluctance": "Opposition to the line of force",
#         "Energy": "Capacity to do work  is called as energy", "Pointers": "Data storing concepts"}
#
# ask = input("Enter the concept name that u want a perfect defination :")
# again_ask = ask.capitalize()
# print(Def[again_ask])

# var = Def.keys()
# print(var)



# print(Def[ask])

# Logic :
# set........ enter by user
# ask = set...assign set in ask variable
# Def[set].....set is a key
# Output : It is the collection of an data.....Using keys we can fetch their values



# Practise:

# %name = "xyz"
# print(%name)

# 123abc = 1012
# print(123abc)
#
# print(11(12+13))
# print((5*6)(7+8))

# 12 = "var"

# print("one"+"2")
#
# list1 = [3,2,5,6,0,7,0,9]
# sum=0
# sum1=0
# for elem in list1 :
#     if(elem%2==0):
#         sum=sum+elem
#         continue
#     if (elem%3==0):
#         sum1=sum1+elem
#     print(sum, end=" ")
#     print(sum1)

# list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(list1[])
#
# false = "hiii"
# x = false
# print(type(false))
